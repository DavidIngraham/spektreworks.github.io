# SpektreWorks Product Documentation

In order to best provide our customers with up-to-date information regarding our products, we have chosen to host our
documentation on github pages. This website serves as our online user manual, and will be the repository for all future
product documentation.

## Contributing

If you have any questions about the documentation, or would like to request more information, please raise an issue over
at our [github repository](https://github.com/SpektreWorks/spektreworks.github.io/issues/new). If you are familiar with
markdown and would like to contribute changes yourself, feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/SpektreWorks/spektreworks.github.io/pulls).
