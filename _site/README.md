SpektreWorks Documentation Website
==================================

SpektreWorks is using this git repository to manage all of our product documentation. This site is very much under
construction. PR's and Issue requests are very welcome!

The design of the site is heavily inspired by the [Blue Robotics Documentation Site](BlueRobotics.github.io). This is our
proof of concept for a beautiful documentation repository using githubpages/jekyll

Minor parts of our HTML/CSS for this repository were remixed from the BlueRobotics site, so we have kept the original license
